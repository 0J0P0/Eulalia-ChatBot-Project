The present project seeks to validate the technological feasibility of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, for the management of structured data of Barcelona City Council, as the public entity faces the challenge of streamlining processes internal data analysis to improve operational efficiency. To solve such objective, the conversational bot Eul√†lia has been developed, intended to answer queries from municipal managers through the use of natural language. Based on the implementation of the best open source text-to-SQL model that existed at the beginning, this has been improved and adapted to the specific data of the City Council, thus maximizing its performance. The implemented model has an accuracy of 65%, comparable to the best current models applied to real-world databases. The rapid evolution of the state of the art means that in the coming months a substantial improvement in the quality of this type of model is expected, showing a promising future for future versions of Eul√†lia.

Eul√†lia is a chat assistant designed to offer internal support to Barcelona City Council's technical team. Its main task is to provide answers to questions from technicians using databases that contain detailed information on the services and statistics offered by Barcelona City Council.

## Installation and Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
```sh
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
```sh
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## Usage

For easier use of Eul√†lia, it is recommended to use the web version of the application. In this you must register a username and password to access the application. Once inside, you can access Eul√†lia's conversational chat.

To start using Eul√†lia, simply type your question in the chat text box and press the send button. Eul√†lia will respond to you with the information you need.

In addition to having the chat, Eul√†lia also has sections for additional information related to the project and the team members. As well as a contact section to get in touch with the Eul√†lia team.

## Authors
The team of developers is made up of a group of 10 students from the 3rd year of the Data Science and Engineering degree at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.
